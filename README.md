# Tasks
* Calculate Basket Total: Develop functionality to calculate the total price of all items in a customer's basket.
  * If a customer purchases the same item more than five times, they should receive a 10% discount on that specific item.
* Optional Additional Tasks:
  * WinForms: Implement the ability to remove items from both the customer and the product lists within the user interface.
  * API: The current total price is only shown in EUR but should also be displayed in USD. Use the public API `https://open.er-api.com/v6/latest/EUR` to get the current exchange rate.
